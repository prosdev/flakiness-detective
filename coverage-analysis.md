# Coverage Analysis

## Current Coverage Status

The current overall test coverage is 72.54%. We've made significant improvements to the coverage from the initial ~39% to the current level. Here's a breakdown of the current coverage by component:

| Component | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Function Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **packages/adapters/src/embedding** | 80.35% | 60% | 75% | Google GenAI provider improved |
| **packages/adapters/src/file-system** | 85.71% | 61.11% | 100% | Needs more branch coverage |
| **packages/adapters/src/firestore** | 66.66% | 71.42% | 57.14% | Good progress, needs function tests |
| **packages/adapters/src/generic-db** | 90.69% | 86.66% | 100% | InMemoryAdapter nearly complete |
| **packages/adapters/src/integrations** | 93.98% | 100% | 50% | High line coverage, needs function tests |
| **packages/adapters/src/playwright** | 94.28% | 85.71% | 94.73% | Excellent coverage overall |
| **packages/core/src/analysis** | 97.97% | 81.48% | 100% | Pattern detection has excellent coverage |
| **packages/core/src/clustering** | 87.82% | 62.16% | 100% | DBSCAN algorithm needs branch coverage |
| **packages/core/src/embedding** | 100% | 100% | 100% | Embedding provider fully covered |
| **packages/core/src** | 70% | 80% | 80% | FlakinessDetective core tests improved |

## Areas for Improvement

To reach the goal of 90% overall coverage, we should focus on the following areas:

1. **Firestore Adapter (66.66%)**
   - Improve test coverage for firestore-adapter.ts
   - Add tests for service account initialization path (mock require properly)
   - Test error handling cases

2. **File System Adapter (85.71%)**
   - Improve branch coverage from 61.11% to at least 80%
   - Add tests for file system error conditions

3. **DBSCAN Clustering (87.82%)**
   - Improve branch coverage from 62.16% to at least 80%
   - Add tests for edge cases in clustering algorithm

4. **Google GenAI Provider (80.35%)**
   - Improve branch coverage for error handling

5. **PlaywrightAdapter**
   - Improve branch coverage from 85.71% to 90%+

## General Observations

1. The pattern detection module (previously at 1.01%) now has 97.97% line coverage
2. The embedding provider (previously at 16.66%) now has 100% coverage
3. The Playwright adapter and detective have excellent coverage (94%+)
4. Core FlakinessDetective improved from being problematic to 70% coverage

## Next Steps

1. Create additional tests for the DBSCAN clustering algorithm focusing on branch coverage
2. Improve test coverage for the Firestore adapter, particularly function coverage
3. Enhance the file system adapter tests with more branch coverage
4. Fix the problematic flakiness-detective.test.ts file to improve overall core coverage

With these improvements, we should be able to reach the 90% coverage goal.
